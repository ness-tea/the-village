# The-Village
A 2D platformer game made with Unity and C#

1 Overview
1.1 The Backstory
You start out in a small village, surrounded by the Dark Abyss. In this village, its
always dark and humid, and the villagers exhibit many strange behaviours and conform to a
very particular way of living. One of these particularities is the village-wide superstition of
always keeping a lock - containing a secret note - on themselves. This secret note contains
a message that they have written for themselves, and - as the superstition goes - so long as
they keep that note close to them, they'll be granted with whatever their heart yearns for
most. You never really adhere to this belief but being raised in the village your entire life
has gotten you accustomed to living alongside it.
One day, as you're exploring the surrounding area, you stumble across a strange pit in
the ground. You examine it closer, and to your disbelief, you find a pile of crunched up secret
notes. You acknowledge that you shouldnt read them, but curiosity continuously feeds you
and you succumb to it. Uneasiness consumes you as you unravel the notes and absorb the
scribbled messages across the crumpled papers: Free yourself, Find an escape, There
is no way out. You realize that the village is hiding many secrets - and from there, you
embark on your journey to uncover them . . .
1.2 Genre
The Village is a 2D puzzle-platform-adventure game. The player will get to
navigate and explore the world that their character is placed in, while investigating into
the mystery behind the village by interacting with dierent characters, discovering hidden
gems, and eventually, escaping and venturing beyond the village boundaries. This will
give the game an adventurous aspect. Although most platform games tend to fall into the
action genre where users will get to navigate around moving platforms and constantly be
challenged in their reaction skills, The Village won't involve anything beyond jumping from
one stationary platform to another or navigating through uneven terrain. It will focus more
on the story and puzzle elements that it has to oer.
1.3 Atmosphere
The goal for this game is to achieve a dark, creepy, and sinister atmosphere. This will
be aided with the colour palette choice for designing and building the game world and may
potentially be supported with audial eects such as music and sounds that will help convey
those atmospheric themes.

2 Game Specifications
2.1 Expected Play Duration
The Village will have a predetermined story that the player must advance through by
uncovering and solving puzzles as they progress in the game. Hence, the time for the player
to get through the entire story and finish the game will be subjective, based on how fast the
player can pick up clues and solve the puzzles. With the assumption that the player solves
all the puzzles in proper sequence, with no stalling time, the expected duration for them to
complete the game should be approximately 5 minutes. This is a tentative play duration
and may be altered to fit a scope that will work well with the semester.
2.2 The Game World
2.2.1 Aesthetic
The universe of The Village is encompassed by the Dark Abyss; a world that is dark,
humid, and retains no sources of light. The only light that illuminates the village is the
slight iridescent glow emitted by the fireflies that populate the area. Otherwise, the world is
painted in very washed-out hues of blue, purple, and yellow. The village is seen as the only
place to seek safety from; venturing too far beyond the village boundaries and into the Dark
Abyss is seen as a danger zone.
2.2.2 Culture & Morals
The villagers value living in solitude, and are not the most spirited community. The only
event that takes place in the village is the annual ceremony where every villager has to write
their secret note. Otherwise, all villagers keep to themselves.
A secret note is a piece of paper containing a personal message that is written by a
villager and is directed to themself. Every villager owns a secret note, and keeps it by their
side at all times, under the belief that it will be a testament of a future event. The villagers
also believe that the fireflies that illuminate the village are all the wishes written in secret
notes that have been fulfilled.
2.3 Levels
The levels will be equivalent to checkpoints in the game. Checkpoints will be marked
or defined at certain puzzles/clues throughout the game. The game is a predetermined story
- meaning that the game will be played in a linear fashion, and the levels are reached in
sequential order. In other words, the game will be designed so that it won't be possible for
the player to achieve a certain checkpoint unless all checkpoints that precede it have been
achieved. Whenever a player surpasses that puzzle or discovers that checkpointed clue, they
will achieve a checkpoint - or level - and move on to the next level.

Whenever a player saves and exits the game, they will resume gameplay at the last
checkpoint they've achieved regardless of how far they've gotten past that checkpoint.
An outline of possible checkpoints:
1. Player talks to three villagers and gains insight on the village backstory.
2. Player wanders into woods and finds crumpled secret notes.
3. Player goes into village and speaks with mayor.
4. Player initiates an incidient in the village to distract all the villagers, and successfully
escapes village.
5. Player roams through the Dark Abyss and meets their fate.
2.4 Challenges
One of the biggest challenges that will come with The Village is the fact that no
backstory will be provided to the player. They will be expected to navigate through the
game and find all the checkpoints on their own. Haivng this sort of gameplay will hopefully
work to trigger anticipation and engagement in the player, as they work themselves through
the game to discover the context of the story. With every checkpoint that they accomplish,
more information about the game will be revealed and they will be closer to identifying what
their end goal is - which is to escape the villlage.
With respect to the checkpoints, the biggest challenges will come in checkponits 4 and
5. At checkpoint 4, the player will need to figure out what they'll need to do to distract
the villagers and escape the village. As there is only one incident that they could trigger
as distraction, they'll need to use hints and clues from the environment of the game world
to determine what that incident could be. At checkpoint 5, the player will be expected to
make their way through the Dark Abyss surrounding the village. The Dark Abyss will be
designed in a way where the player will need to maneuver through a maze and successively
choose either a left or right path to reach the end of the game.
